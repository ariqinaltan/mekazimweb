<time>23 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><span>American professional basketball player Gordon Hayward has enjoyed great career success since making his professional debut in 2010 with Utah Jazz.&nbsp;Hayward moved to Boston Celtics in 2017. This article contains some interesting facts about the Indiana native.</span></p><h2><span>Gordon Hayward, wife, family</span></h2><p><span>Having been in a long-term relationship, five years to be precise, with a certain Kolbi Killingback that eventually ended, Gordon wasn’t ready for another long-term relationship when he fell in love again.</span></p><p><span>In 2014, about two years after his relationship ended, Gordon was ready to walk down the aisle with&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Robyn Hayward (née Van Vilet),</span></strong><span>&nbsp;a fellow Indiana native who he had dated for just 5 months.</span></p><p><span>Also Read: Russell Westbrook Wife, Brother, Son, Net Worth, Height, Girlfriend, Gay</span></p><p><span>The media did not specify the details of their first meeting.&nbsp;However, some believe the duo should have met in Indiana, where they both grew up and studied.</span></p><p><span>By the time they started dating (2013), Robyn was a senior in high school, while Gordon, who had left college, was already playing in the NBA, thus thrusting their relationship into the limelight.</span></p><p><span>On Christmas Eve 2013, Gordon asked Robyn to marry him so she was excited enough to share it with fans on Instagram with a caption in which she referred to Gordon as love. of his life…</span></p><p><span>It took them about five months to plan their wedding which took place at St. Simon the Apostle Church in Indianapolis on May 24, 2014.</span></p><p><span>Although Gordon hasn’t revealed exactly what attracted him to Robyn, it’s highly likely that she understands the fact that she, like him, is an athlete.&nbsp;Born on April 8, 1995, Robyn played high school volleyball (Indianapolis Bishop Chatered High School) and she was amazing.&nbsp;Nope!&nbsp;we are not chopping words.&nbsp;She was ranked the 4th best volleyball player in Indiana by Max Preps.</span></p><p><span>In 2012, his team won the 2012 national championship title, thanks a lot to Robyn’s tenacity as a powerful defensive specialist.&nbsp;She was elderly and about 5 feet 5 inches tall.&nbsp;Too bad she didn’t opt ​​for a college career.</span></p><p><span>Another possible reason that could have made Gordon fall in love with his wife is the fact that she is selfless.&nbsp;During her high school years, Robyn spent a lot of time volunteering, including giving out free food to the needy.&nbsp;And it runs in his family.&nbsp;Gordon’s in-laws are making a philanthropic contribution to a school in Magdalena, Guatemala.</span></p><p><span>While it is somewhat disappointing that Gordon’s wife did not pursue a college career in volleyball, she did, however, cover herself with cosmetology parentage after attending beauty school.</span></p><p><span>Like their marriage, Gordon and Robyn wasted no time in starting a family.&nbsp;Following an announcement from Gordon in February 2015, their first daughter, Bernadette Marie Hayward, was born on June 6, 2015.</span></p><p><span>Just over a year later, the couple added another daughter to their family.&nbsp;Born on July 11, 2016, her name was Charlotte Margaret Hayward.&nbsp;Gordon is a family man, he retired from the United States team for the Summer Olympics in Rio, in order to be by his wife’s side when the baby arrived.</span></p><h2><span>sister, parents</span></h2><p><span>Hayward was born to Gordon Daniel Hayward, born March 23, 1990 in Indianapolis, Indiana.&nbsp;He has a twin sister named Heather.&nbsp;Along with his twin, Gordon had early aspirations of becoming a professional athlete specializing in tennis and basketball.</span></p><p><span>However, as Gordon was more passionate about basketball, he decided to focus on tennis as he felt he was not tall enough to succeed in the sport, seeing both his parents,&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Gordon Scott Hayward and Jody Hayward</span></strong><span>&nbsp;standing at 5 feet 10 inches.</span></p><p><span>Gordon’s parents supported him every step of the way.&nbsp;When his decision was made to drop basketball in high school, his mother persuaded him to play for another year and Gordon was in the most excited shock of his life when he began to grow like no one could guess.</span></p><p><span>He went from 5’11 as a freshman to 6’4” in his sophomore year.</span></p><p><span>His high school stats allowed him to choose from three scholarships, including his parents’ alma mater, Purdue, which he and his twin sister had originally wanted to attend.</span></p><p><span>However, Gordon would choose Butler, who had an hour of practice at 6:30 a.m., which would make his major projects in computer engineering less difficult.</span></p><p><span>Two years out of college, Gordon’s impressive skills on the court, especially his performance at the FIBA ​​U19 Under-19 World Championship in Auckland, New Zealand, saw him attract a handful of players. scouts able to convince his parents that he was ready for the NBA.</span></p><p><span>Gordon’s decision to let him into the 2010 draft wasn’t instant, as they had to go through a series of deliberations to ensure they were doing exactly what was right for their son.</span></p><p><span>He was selected by Utah Jazz, marking the start of his NBA career.&nbsp;After seven good years with the Jazz, Gordon switched teams in 2017 and signed for the Boston Celtics on a 4-year deal worth around $128 million.&nbsp;He was also named an NBA All-Star for the first time.</span></p><h2><span>Injury</span></h2><p><span>Injuries and athletes are simply inseparable.&nbsp;Barely six months with his new team, Hayward suffered a horrific ankle injury that left him with a broken tibia.</span></p><p><span>Also Read: Nina Earl Biography, Height, Married, Husband, Children, Family</span></p><p><span>In a season opener against LeBron James’ Cleveland Cavaliers in October 2017, Hayward landed horribly in a way that knocked his legs off balance.&nbsp;Watch the video here.&nbsp;Be warned though, only a few on the court could handle Hayward’s twisted leg.</span></p><p><span>He had to undergo surgery to remedy the situation.&nbsp;In January 2018, around three months after the injury, Hayward was spotted without his ankle bracelets which helped with walking and fans couldn’t help but see it as a good sign that their star man would be back on the court again. sooner than expected.</span></p><h2><span>House</span></h2><p><span>With an estimated salary of $30 million.&nbsp;PS: he earned $57.3 million in salary alone with the Jazz, Gordon earned the right to live like a king.</span></p><p><span>It has a number of houses scattered all over the country.&nbsp;In October 2015, the LA Times reported that he had dropped $3.35 million on a gated ranch with a tennis court in Rancho Santa Fe, California.&nbsp;The mansion includes 6 bedrooms, 8 bathrooms, a freestanding guest house, a spa, a swimming pool and much more.</span></p><p><span>Gordon has another home in Sandy Utah valued at around $700,000.</span></p><h2><span>Height: 2.0 m (6 ft 8 in)</span></h2><p><span>While his recorded NBA height is 6ft 8in, Gordon is actually 6ft 9in.&nbsp;He added another inch during his college years at Butler University.</span></p><p class=postsid
