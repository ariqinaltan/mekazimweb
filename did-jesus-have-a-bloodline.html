Certain clues emerge through the works of Leonardo Da Vinci.<h2>Who are the descendants of Jesus and Mary Magdalene?</h2>Holy Blood, Holy Grail suggests that the Merovingian kings were the descendants of Jesus and Mary Magdalene, and that their descendants founded the Priory of Sion. The book argued that the Knights Templar, an order that really existed in the 12th century, originated as the military wing of the Priory of Sion.<h2>Did God have a wife?</h2>God had a wife, Asherah, whom the Book of Kings suggests was worshiped alongside Yahweh in his temple in Israel, according to an Oxford scholar.

Historians Margarita Torres and José Miguel Ortega del Rio claim the Holy Grail resides inside the Basilica of San Isidoro in the northern Spanish city of León. Others claim the Grail can be found in Valencia Cathedral.<h2>Is the Holy Grail in the Bible?</h2>Holy Grail<p>According to the Bible, "Then he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them [the disciples], saying, 'Drink from it, all of you. This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. '" Matthew 26:27-28.</p><h2>Who is the son of Jesus?</h2>Jacobovici and Pellegrino argue that Aramaic inscriptions reading "Judah, son of Jesus", "Jesus, son of Joseph", and "Mariamne", a name they associate with Mary Magdalene, together preserve the record of a family group consisting of Jesus, his wife Mary Magdalene and son Judah.<h2>How many kids did Mary and Joseph have?</h2>They may have been: (1) the sons of Mary, the mother of Jesus, and Joseph (the most natural inference); (2) sons of the Mary named in Mark 15:40 as "mother of James and Joses", whom Jerome identified with the wife of Clopas and sister of Mary the mother of Jesus; or (3) sons of Joseph by a former marriage.<h2>What color was Mary Magdalene?</h2>The saint depicted here is Mary Magdalene, identifiable by the ointment jar she holds and by her robes of bright scarlet, a colour traditionally associated with her.<h2>Has anyone seen the Holy Grail?</h2>Many historians are skeptical of the latest claim of the Holy Grail's discovery, and there's no evidence that the Holy Grail even exists.<h2>Where is Mary Magdalene buried?</h2>538 – 594), Mary Magdalene is said to have retired to Ephesus in Asia Minor with Mary the mother of Jesus, where they both lived out the rests of their lives.

According to Eastern tradition, she accompanied St. John the Apostle to Ephesus, where she died and was buried. French tradition spuriously claims that she evangelized Provence (southeastern France) and spent her last 30 years in an Alpine cavern.<h2>Who is Mary Magdalene in Da Vinci Code?</h2>And so, the book concludes, Da Vinci is trying to tell us that Mary Magdalene was the "holy vessel" who carried "the royal bloodline of Jesus Christ" by bearing his child. Starbird: And probably a girl child since the vessel, the shape, the cup is actually a feminine symbol.<h2>What books of the Bible are forbidden?</h2>The Gospel of Nicodemus, formerly called The Acts of Pontius Pilate.
