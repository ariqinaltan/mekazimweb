Haener grew up in Danville, California and went to Monte Vista High School in the same city. He had amazing numbers for his high school, throwing for 8,464 yards and 90 touchdowns which is a school record. However, his college record has not been so great and there are many limitations to his game.</p><p dir=ltr>Haener first attended the University of Washington in 2017 but redshirted his Freshman year. In 2018, still as a backup he saw very little game time and in 2019 he transferred to Fresno State where he had to sit out for the season due to transfer policy. Since 2020, Haener has been the starting quarterback but has made little waves across the league. In the 2023’s Senior Bowl, Haener was named the game MVP.</p><p dir=ltr>As per various scouting reports, the 24 year old quarterback is below average in terms of size and arm talent. However, he has an above average football IQ and is excellent at getting the ball out during blitzes, can sense edge pressure quickly and move away from potential danger. His touchdown to interception ratio is not too shabby at 53:12 respectively but his major flaw is that his arm talent is not up to the mark at the NFL level. Haener is considered as an average backup at best.</p><h2 id=jake-haener-net-worth-0 dir=ltr>Jake Haener’s Net Worth</h2><p dir=ltr><strong>Jake Haener’s overall net worth stated at On3 is at $297K.</strong> As a starting quarterback for the Fresno State Bulldogs, Haener should have had ample opportunity to make the best of the NIL world. However, that is not the case as there are no reports linking him to any deals.</p><p dir=ltr>Jake’s family background is quite good, his mother Julie has been an anchor for a long time with KTVU-TV in Oakland. Nevertheless, Jake did speak with Gabe Camarillo (who covers Fresno State Football) and mentioned that as far as NIL deals are concerned, he has done a couple of things and spoken with a few people, but his main focus remains on his football at Fresno State.</p><p>I also asked Jake Haener about any interest in an NIL deal now or down the road. Here was his response:</p>I also asked Jake Haener about any interest in an NIL deal now or down the road. Here was his response: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://t.co/az3SPRY4vS</a><p dir=ltr>He went on to further state that he doesn’t really have the need to go out of the way for money right now and that all the money he has made till now or makes, he will donate it back to Fresno.</p><h2 id=jake-haener-net-worth-faq>FAQs</h2><h3 class=faq-question-element readability=1>Q.
