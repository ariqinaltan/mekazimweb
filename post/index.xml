Thom Browne對《小王子》的演繹堪稱用心，絕不是胡掰硬套而已，第一套Look是廓形誇張、縫有品牌標誌性紅白藍條紋的太空服，與《小王子》開頭的飛機失事而相遇不謀而合，接著是六套連衣裙，上頭的印花分別代表小王子與飛行員相遇前曾拜訪的不同星球。品牌著名的灰色西裝以兩種不同形式呈現：巨型肩線的特大號西裝是權威大人的正裝；以各式面料與剪裁解構的趣味西裝是孩子們的衣著。
《小王子》的結局令人悵然若失，或許因為Thom Browne熱愛圓滿結局，又或許因為走秀這天正好是情人節，當節目接近尾聲時，〈You’ll Never Walk Alone〉的樂聲突然響起，模特兒不再形單影隻，雙雙對對的走回後台，為本場秀劃下溫暖的句點。

In warm weather, however, blinds beat curtains in energy efficiency. Because blinds leak more heat from a room, they also decrease indoor heat gain more efficiently in the summer, by around 45 percent, which can lower your AC bills. Do blinds or curtains keep cold out? Venetian blinds are also not as effective as a roller or roman blind as their slats enable cold air to enter your room.</description></item><item><title>Avril Lavigne suffers major fashion mishap in mesh bodysuit and tartan mini skirt</title><link>/avril-lavigne-fashion-mishap-mesh-bodysuit-and-tartan-mini-skirt.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/avril-lavigne-fashion-mishap-mesh-bodysuit-and-tartan-mini-skirt.html</guid><description>Avril Lavigne, 38, is delighting audiences across Europe as she takes to the stage for her&amp;nbsp;Love Sux tour, rocking a series of daring on-stage outfits synonymous with her punk-rock sartorial era of the noughties.&amp;nbsp;

顧名思義，整部電影就是在講述一位讓男主角難忘的女孩，Annie Hall。Annie Hall不同於一般紐約女孩那樣精明伶俐，反而帶著點天真的傻氣。她把吃一半的三明治丟車裡，她的口頭禪是La Di Da，她不穿甜美性感的迷你裙或緊身洋裝，寬鬆的褲子、西裝背心裡繫上領帶，最好再加一副復古墨鏡，才是Annie Hall的Style。Annie Hall引領起了中性穿搭的風潮，儘管已過了40年，她的風格依舊不敗，成為影史中的經典時尚Icon。
・《曼哈頓Manhattan》的Mary Wilkie
當原本飾演Annie Hall的黛安·基頓（Diane Keaton）走進《曼哈頓》，她就搖身成為了聰明獨立的新女性，甚至也帶著伍迪·艾倫（Woody Allen）式的神經質；她與男主角句句針鋒相對，卻又在齟齬中併發愛戀。依舊是帶著中性氣質的打扮，但Mary Wilkie的品味更偏向懷舊的學院風，隨性中展現細膩，2012年時設計師Scott Sternberg甚至依照Mary Wilkie的風格為美國品牌Band of Outsiders設計出了早秋系列（ㄧ 度停擺的Band of Outsiders 也將在2017紐約春夏時裝週回歸！）。
・《甜蜜與卑微Sweet and Lowdown》的Hattie與Blanche
西恩·潘 (Sean Penn)輕輕撥弄吉他琴弦，關於愛情的甜蜜與卑微隨著旋律緩緩散開。他飾演的Emmet Ray，號稱世界第二的吉他手，他盤旋於眾多女性之間，薩曼莎·莫頓（Samantha Morton）飾演的啞巴洗衣工Hattie卻是一直默默的仰慕著這位驕傲自負的吉他手，總是穿著暖色系的Hattie，喜歡紅色針織帽、鵝黃色洋裝，或是一頂彩色條紋圓帽搭配圓點連身裙，她女孩子氣的可愛打扮充滿天真無邪的溫暖氣質。而鄔瑪·舒曼（Uma Thurman）飾演的名媛Blanche則是與Hattie有著極大反差，她成熟世故，她精明也冷血，她身穿皮草或貼身禮服，一頭金色捲髮則透露她的高貴奢華，兩個女主角的個性都在服裝穿搭上有跡可循。

・《午夜巴黎Midnight in Paris》的Adriana
在巴黎的午夜搭上馬車，過了12點，你就能找到屬於你的美好年代。電影編劇Gil搭上了那輛馬車，他遇見海明威與費茲傑羅，也和達利及曼˙雷碰上了一面，他給葛楚˙史坦審閱他的小說，然後他愛上了畢卡索的情人－Adriana。有別於Gil在21世紀的未婚妻，1920年代的Adriana浪漫而勇敢，聰慧而充滿藝術氣息，冒險精神與神秘氣息共存在她的雙眼裡；她穿白色絲綢洋裝時能夠展現復古典雅，而當她金色禮服上的流蘇閃動、纖細的手指夾著優雅長煙，又透露出20年代女性獨有的傲慢與高貴，這是伍迪·艾倫（Woody Allen）假想畢卡索擁有的繆思形象，也是他本人深深著迷的女性特質。

・《藍色茉莉Blue Jasmine》的Jasmine
當紐約貴婦破了產，名牌包是她流浪時的唯一家當。原本生活在上流社會享盡奢華的曼哈頓名媛Jasmine，當她失去了所有財產、失去了丈夫，她淪落為瀕臨精神崩潰的流浪貴婦，只有Hermès柏金包與Chanel外套相依偎。造型師Suzy Benzinger成功打造了紐約上東區的富豪女性打扮，Jasmine從頭到腳一絲不苟的單品挑選，展現了她即使身敗名裂仍然要奮力維持的品味。在這樣光鮮亮麗的體面裝扮下，是一個破碎的人生，伍迪·艾倫（Woody Allen）以Jasmine的高級時尚與她挫敗失序的命運做出極大的諷刺與反差。

・《魔幻月光Magic in the Moonlight》的Sophie
大魔術師遇見通靈少女，愛情也同魔法般神奇降臨。艾瑪史東（Emma Stone）
在電影中完美演繹了古靈精怪又開朗的靈媒Sophie，她與生俱來的活潑魅力也成為了整部電影的精髓所在。俏皮的Sophie總是一身春天般的亮色系穿搭，蜜桃色的打摺洋裝或紅白海軍服都傳達出她的浪漫俏麗，而中年魔術師Stanley悲觀中又帶著刻薄，暗色系的西裝是他內斂的表現，兩個主角的個性對比在服裝造型上顯而易見。

・《咖啡・愛情Café Society》的Vonnie
這個故事是關於伍迪·艾倫（Woody Allen）著迷的1930年代，1930年的好萊塢，繁華、荒誕、浪漫，而《咖啡˙愛情》是關於一對平凡男女在這眼花撩亂花花世界裡的平凡愛情。克莉絲汀·史都華（Kristen Stewart）飾演的年輕秘書Sophie，聰慧迷人，在這個紙醉金迷的世界裡，她是清新淡雅的存在。粉色打結襯衫透露出年輕俏皮，以及一絲叛逆氣質；當她換上全白連身裙，又能展現精緻的優雅格調，伍迪·艾倫（Woody Allen）筆下的Sophie，如同咖啡般散發淡雅醇香。</description></item><item><title> Israel Houghton We Speak To Natio</title><link>/we-speak-to-nations-html.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/we-speak-to-nations-html.html</guid><description>Hear the sound

Answer
Light output per watt for halogen lamps is between 14 and 20 lumens per watt (lm/W). A 500W halogen lamp generates 500 * 14 = 7000 lumens, which is the result of this equation.
Aside from that, what is the LED equivalent of a 500w halogen lamp? LED lights that produce 5000lm / (140lm/W) = 36W or 10000 /140 = 70W are available. As a result, 36W to 70W LED lights provide the same light output as 500W halogen bulbs.</description></item><item><title>I live in America's dirtiest city with the biggest cockroach problem - I know I helped win it the ti</title><link>/americas-dirtest-city-houston-texas-cockroaches-tiktok-pests.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/americas-dirtest-city-houston-texas-cockroaches-tiktok-pests.html</guid><description>A TIKTOKER who lives in "America's most cockroach-infested city" has said he helped secure the title.

Even if one is tempted to trivialize his comeback, the reality of Nigerian Afrobeats stars and their frequent music releases strongly becomes a stumbling block to that bias. This, therefore, easily hands Runtown commendations for his boldness.&amp;nbsp;

Water freezes at 32 degrees Fahrenheit, whereas soap freezes at between 12 and 14 degrees Fahrenheit. This is why bubbles freeze at low conditions because the freezing point of water is 32 degrees Fahrenheit, but the freezing point of soap is between 12 and 14 degrees Fahrenheit.

Make a “hornet’s nest” out of anything (grey bag filled with plastic bags) Wood boring bees will not trespass since they are a natural opponent of hornets. This is quite effective. This and other self-help pins were discovered by The Brave Cowboy.
As a result, do fictitious wasp nests deter the presence of bees? When a scout wasp is looking for a spot to establish a colony, they will often avoid placing its nest in close proximity to an established hornet’s nest.</description></item><item><title>Elmo Asked How Everyone Was Doing, and Twitter Decided to Trauma Dump</title><link>/elmo-how-are-you-doing-twitter-1235811025.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/elmo-how-are-you-doing-twitter-1235811025.html</guid><description>“Elmo is just checking in!

30 thousandths indicates that if you split anything into one thousand equal parts, 30 thousandths equals the sum of the sum of the sum of the parts that you have just divided. Because thirty thousandths is thirty thousandths above one thousand, thirty thousandths as a fraction is thirty thousandths of a thousandth. As a decimal, 30 thousandths is equal to 0.030, which is 30 thousandths divided by one thousand equals 30 thousandths.</description></item><item><title>How much is Stan Wawrinkas net worth in 2023?</title><link>/stan-wawrinka-net-worth.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/stan-wawrinka-net-worth.html</guid><description>NameStanislas WawrinkaNet WorthEstimated $20 millionAge38 years old (born March 28, 1985)ResidenceFounex, SwitzerlandMarital StatusDivorcedCareer Prize Money$36,272,404Source of WealthTennis prize money, endorsementsEndorsementsYonex, Babolat, Head, and TGV Lyria.Stan WawrinkaSwiss tennis player Stanislas Wawrinka was born on March 28, 1985.
