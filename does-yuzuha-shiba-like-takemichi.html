As a child, Takemichi saved a young Hinata Tachibana from bullies. This caused Hinata to have a long-lasting crush on him and incurred the jealousy of Kisaki, who liked Hinata.</p><h2>Who does Mitsuya have a crush on?</h2>“Mitsuya has a crush on Y/N-chan!” Thankfully, Mikey whispered back instead of outright saying it aloud.<h2>Does Senju like Takemichi?</h2>Despite not having met each other in the previous timelines, Senju bonds with Takemichi very well. He was primarily her target because of his necessary alliance with Brahman that would help the gang in defeating Manjiro Sano and the Kanto Manji Gang, but she soon comes to trust him as they hang out and become friends.<h2>Does Mikey like Takemichi?</h2>Takemichi Hanagaki<p>Later on, they become very close friends. Mikey has remarked that Takemichi is reminiscent of his deceased brother who, even though his fighting prowess was mediocre, was valiant in battle and was an excellent leader. Over time, Mikey comes to rely on Takemichi emotionally.</p><h2>?Tokyo revengers react to Takemichi as Yuzuha Shiba?•1/2•||Alltake or Original?|•(Fem.Take Au)•MyAu•</h2><p></p><h2>Who does Mikey have a crush on?</h2>Renet: In the events of "Turtles in Time", Mikey began to develop a crush on Renet, the time travel mistress apprentice.<h2>Does Mikey love Emma?</h2>According to Hina, Emma's eyes show that she's clearly in love with Mikey. Yamagishi reveals that Emma and Mikey have even taken the next step: they're living together! Hina gets so riled up that she marches straight toward Mikey and Emma to confront them.<h2>Is Senju Tokyo Revengers a girl?</h2>Senju is a young woman of below-average height with short light pink hair, green eyes, and prominent eyelashes, sharing similar facial characteristics with her older brother, Haruchiyo Sanzu. Due to her layered tousled bob hairstyle with unruly waves and blunt edges, she is often mistaken for a boy.<h2>How old is Takemichi?</h2>Takemichi is a 26-year-old man who works part-time at a convenience store.<h2>Does takeomi care about Senju?</h2>He takes care of Senju's duties when she is not tending to them and serves her as a proper advisor, becoming her voice of reason for the more emotional and idealistic side of herself, particularly when he is angered.<h2>Does Mitsuya love Hakkai?</h2>Hakkai was the vice-captain for Mitsuya's second division and showed great admiration for his captain, even using Mitsuya's picture as his lock screen. He sees Mitsuya as a real older brother, describing their relationship as "unfortunately close".<h2>What is Mitsuya to Yuzuha?</h2>Yuzuha sees him as a brother and he seems to see her as a little sister.<h2>Will Takemichi become leader?</h2>Takemichi becomes a member of the gang and soon, the First Division Captain. His involvement in Toman would later serve as a way for him to become the leader of the 11th Generation Black Dragon. As of his latest time leap, Takemichi is the leader of the Second Generation Tokyo Manji Gang.<h2>Does Takemichi get stronger?</h2>However, Takemichi keeps getting pitted against stronger and stronger opponents, and often gets beaten within an inch of his life. One of Takemichi's most admirable qualities is his ability to persevere.<h2>Is Takemichi able to save Hina?</h2>Takemichi's last journey through time with Naoto resulted in Hina being alive and Toman saved. It was a happy ending for everyone -- except for Mikey.<h2>Is Takemichi the only time leaper?</h2>The fandom has long speculated that there may be more time leapers apart from Takemichi. For a while, the suspicion had fallen on Kisaki, followed by Hanma and then Mikey. However, Tokyo Revengers Chapter 256 posits Haruchiyo as a candidate as well.<h2>Who is strongest character in Tokyo Revengers?</h2>1) Mikey (Sano Manjirō)<p>The "Invincible" Mikey, is a well-deserved nickname for the strongest character in Tokyo Revengers. He is the leader of Toman in the past, and the leader of the Kanto Manji gang in the future. No matter how strong or large the opponent, Mikey has never lost a fight.</p><h2>Is Mikey evil?</h2>The message reveals Mikey's conflict over his dark impulses that were kept on check by Shinichiro, Emma and Baji and now terrified of what he can become, he wishes for Takemichi to not look for him. Takemichi realizes Mikey's descent to evil is not external and was caused due to Mikey succumbing to his own darkness.<h2>How old is Senju?</h2>Senju is just 16 years old and extremely short.<h2>Is Sanzu a drug addict?</h2>Haruchiyo is also shown to be on many drugs, which is believed to have played a big part in his insane behavior and personality change.<h2>Does Emma like Takemichi?</h2>Ordered by Izana, Emma gets attacked by Kisaki and killed. Mikey in his despite attempt to save his sister carries her to the hospital on his back when she utters her final request for him to tell Draken that she loves him and for Takemichi to take care of Mikey.<h2>Does Emma like Draken?</h2>Emma Sano likes Draken a lot and everybody around them knows about it. And Draken, Ken Ryuguji likes her, too, but probably nobody around them except for Mikey and Takemichi (→note). Maybe he is too shy to show his feeling. He pretends like he doesn't care about her.<h2>Can kisaki leap time?</h2>The manga confirmed that Kisaki was not a time leaper, but he was aware of the concept of time leaping. This meant that the character was acquainted with someone who had the same ability as Takemichi.<h2>Who is Michelangelo's love interest?</h2>Tommaso dei Cavalieri ( c. 1512 to 1519—1587) was an Italian nobleman, who was the object of the greatest expression of Michelangelo's love. Cavalieri was 23 years old when Michelangelo met him in 1532, at the age of 57.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8OonKxlqarHtrTAZqqhoZKWeq21yp5krZmbmrqqr8ei</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdoes-yuzuha-shiba-like-takemichi.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdoes-yuzuha-shiba-like-takemichi.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdoes-yuzuha-shiba-like-takemichi.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdoes-yuzuha-shiba-like-takemichi.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdoes-yuzuha-shiba-like-takemichi.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdoes-yuzuha-shiba-like-takemichi.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./1438995-emotional-moment-comedian-amarachi-amusi-surprises-mum-with-a-brand-new-toyota-venza-car-gift.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./1438995-emotional-moment-comedian-amarachi-amusi-surprises-mum-with-a-brand-new-toyota-venza-car-gift.html>Emotional Moment Comedian Amarachi Amusi Surprises Mum With a Brand New Toyota Venza Car Gift</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./do-iron-pills-make-your-hair-grow.html>Do iron pills make your hair grow?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./do-iron-pills-make-your-hair-grow.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
