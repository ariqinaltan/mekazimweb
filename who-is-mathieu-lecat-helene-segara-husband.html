In 2002, Hélène was diagnosed with a cyst on her vocal cords, which threatened to end her singing career. She underwent surgery and had to rest her voice for several months. Mathieu helped her recover and encouraged her to pursue her passion. In 2013, Hélène revealed that she suffered from a rare autoimmune disease that affected her eyesight.

According to Voici, a French magazine, the couple has separated after 20 years of marriage and is living in different places. The magazine claims that the reason for their breakup is the distance and the lack of communication, as they have been leading separate lives for a while. Hélène has been busy with her musical projects and her participation in the TV show La France a un incroyable talent, while Mathieu has been focusing on his journalistic and literary work. The magazine also reports that the separation is amicable and that they remain friends and co-parents for their children.</p><p>Neither Mathieu nor Hélène has confirmed or denied the news of their separation, and they have not made any public statement about it. However, some fans have noticed that they have not posted any pictures of each other on their social media accounts for a long time, and that they have not appeared together in any public events. Some fans have also expressed their sadness and shock at the news, as they considered them to be one of the most solid and stable couples in the French showbiz.</p><p><strong>Read Also:- <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Maria Assegaf Biodata, Wiki, Age, Height</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Mathieu_Lecat_A_Mystery_Man></span>Mathieu Lecat: A Mystery Man<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Lecat is a man who prefers to stay away from the spotlight and the media attention.
