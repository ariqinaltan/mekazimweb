In a moving tribute, Jennifer penned: "Norman Lear. <strong>His shows shaped my childhood and getting to know him was one of my greatest honors. He made such a difference. A huge impact on television and humanity.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c948e603cbb7-norman-lear.jpg><p id=eoCg_hDMwu data-wc=56>"He was able to tackle and discuss heated political conversations during difficult and charged times and we were able to laugh and learn. I yearn for those days. When creativity was a learning tool and could inspire people to maybe think just a little bit differently. And of course to laugh. Our greatest source of healing."</p><p id=ejxFWReo_h data-wc=78>Jennifer continued: "He was the kindest and gentlest man. <strong>When you were in his presence, you were the only one in the room. He made everyone feel this. Even when someone believed differently than him.</strong> That's what made life and people interesting to him. To have discussions and really take in how people felt and hear their point of view. He knew how to give voice to all sides and somehow in the process bring people closer together.</p><span class=instagramEmbedCaptionClass_i1wiuf9h>Jennifer shared a tender moment between the pair</span><p id=eESVOWo_Bi data-wc=31>"May we take a page from Norman's playbook as a way of honoring his life.

Loss of life or loss of love. Being able to really SIT in this grief allows you to feel the moments of joy and gratitude for having loved someone that deep. And we loved him deeply. He was such a part of our DNA. We were always the 6 of us. This was a chosen family that forever changed the course of who we were and what our path was going to be."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/645333ab0fc6-gettyimages-637074848.jpg><p id=ehKFA1awZu data-wc=73>She continued: "For Matty, he KNEW he loved to make people laugh. As he said himself, if he didn't hear the ‘laugh’ he thought he was going to die. His life literally depended on it. And boy did he succeed in doing just that. He made all of us laugh. And laugh hard. In the last couple weeks, I've been pouring over our texts to one another.
