First, there are in-salon options. While highly effective, they can cost up to $300 or more and take up a big chunk of time (around three hours, at least). Then, there are at-home keratin treatments. The best versions offer similar smoothing and straightening benefits at a fraction of the price and without many of the harsh chemicals. (Looking at you, formaldehyde).</p><p>But—and this is a big one—it’s important to research before starting a new haircare regimen. Marie Claire turned to <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.pennyjamessalon.com/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Penny James</a>, IAT, AOT, and board-certified trichologist and <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.instagram.com/alexandrarriaga/?hl=en" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Alexandra Arriaga</a>, hair chemist and medical researcher, to find the best at-home keratin treatments for every hair type and concern. As Arriaga says: “Not all at-home keratin treatments are created equal." It’s important to avoid certain chemicals and familiarize yourself with the pros and cons of each treatment variety.</p><p>At-home keratin treatments can be worthwhile, budget-friendly alternatives to a day at the salon. Ahead, the experts provide the best at-home keratin treatment options for your straightest, silkiest hair yet.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-what-to-look-for-in-a-keratin-treatment><span>What to Look For in a Keratin Treatment</span></h2><ul><li><strong>Formaldehyde</strong></li></ul><p>Finding the best at-home keratin treatment is less about what you should see on the label and more about what you shouldn’t see. The big chemical to avoid is a carcinogen called formaldehyde, “a colorless, strong-smelling gas that presents a health hazard when breathed into the lungs, gets into the eyes, or touches the skin,” says Arriaga. According to the <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/substances/formaldehyde/formaldehyde-fact-sheet referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>National Cancer Institute</a>, when formaldehyde reaches a certain concentration in the air (0.1 ppm to be exact), you may experience watery eyes, burning sensations in the eyes, nose, and throat, coughing, wheezing, nausea, and skin irritation. Looking for labels like “No Formaldehyde” or “Formaldehyde Free” on your at-home keratin bottle is a good start, but you’re going to want to do some extra digging. “Many keratin treatments, both professional and at-home options, contain the liquid form of formaldehyde, which is called methylene glycol,” explains Arriaga. “To identify products containing formaldehyde-related ingredients, look for the following words on the label: Formaldehyde, formalin, and methylene glycol.”</p><p>There's a big difference between a true, at-home keratin treatment that can be likened to what you get in a salon and a keratin-infused product—marketing, however, makes sorting through products pretty confusing. The former uses a chemical straightening solution to break and re-seal the hair cuticle, creating a straighter, frizz-free shape. "Avoid any at-home keratin treatment if you have weakening hair," explains James, noting it can cause further dryness and breakage.</p><p>A keratin-infused product, on the other hand, is actually beneficial for hair health. "Keratin-infused products are hair care products that contain keratin, a protein naturally found in hair. These products help strengthen, condition, and repair damaged hair," explains James. "Keratin-infused products work by smoothing the hair cuticle, reducing frizz, and restoring elasticity, resulting in softer, shinier, and more manageable locks."</p><p>"It's crucial to select at-home keratin treatment kits specifically formulated for your hair type and needs. By carefully reading reviews and instructions, choose a product that will deliver the desired results," shares James. Tightly curled or coily hair will likely require a more intense treatment to change the hair shape (just make sure you're going to a reputable provider and have selected a formaldehyde-free treatment), whereas wavy or loosely curled hair will find frizz-taming success with a keratin-infused product.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-how-we-chose-the-best-at-home-keratin-treatments><span>How We Chose The Best At-Home Keratin Treatments</span></h2><p>The products on this list have either been vetted by Marie Claire's Beauty Editor Samantha Holender and <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/author/deena-campbell/>Marie Claire's Beauty Director Deena Campbell</a> or have been hand-selected by hair experts.

The more keratin you have, the smoother, glossier, and shinier your hair will be—it fills the frizz-causing holes in the hair cuticle. That said, not every keratin treatment is created equal. <strong>In a salon, you can expect more dramatic, longer-lasting results</strong>. An in-salon keratin treatment can take curly, coily hair to a straighter state that lasts for weeks or more. <strong>At-home treatments, which can take the form of conditioners, shampoos, masks, or, occasionally, salon-mimicking systems, can work wonders for frizz, but won’t necessarily last through dozens of shampoos or change your natural texture.</strong> The results will also differ across hair types.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-how-do-keratin-treatments-work><span>How Do Keratin Treatments Work?</span></h2><p>When you go to a salon or purchase a profession-grade at-home keratin treatment kit, the hair is typically straightened with a solution containing glyoxylic acid or formaldehyde, explains Arriaga. “When some of these solutions are applied on the hair, <strong>the bonds inside each strand are broken and resealed in a straighter position</strong>.” Trichologist Dr. James adds that a minimum temperature of 450 degrees is needed to seal the deal (pun very much intended) and “glue” the cuticle back together.</p><p>Meanwhile, keratin-infused solutions and products “work by coating each individual strand to smooth down the hair cuticles and give a glossy, frizz-free finish," says Dr. James. "This coating wears off over time, however."</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-how-to-do-a-keratin-treatment-at-home><span>How to Do a Keratin Treatment At-Home</span></h2><p>As tempting as it may be, don’t go straight into treatment mode. Preparation is just as important. <strong>“The pre-treatment will be shampooing your hair with a sulfate-free shampoo,”</strong> says Dr. James. Arriaga also recommends getting your hair colored ahead of your treatment. “Keratin will help preserve the color,” she adds. Just give yourself a few days or weeks of buffer time.</p><p><strong>After you finish your at-home treatment, there are a few key things to avoid, like getting your hair wet or direct sun exposure</strong>. “Even keratin treatments that claim you can wash your hair immediately benefit from waiting at least 24 hours," says <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.instagram.com/alexandraefst/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>Alexandra Efstratiou</u></a>, a New York-based stylist. “It just gives the hair and product time to settle in together.”</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-how-to-make-at-at-home-keratin-treatment-last><span>How to Make at At-Home Keratin Treatment Last</span></h2><p>Simple keratin treatment products that aren't heat-activated provide results that last until your next shampoo.

Consider reducing the wash days in your routine. “<strong>The longevity of a keratin is primarily based on your frequency of washing, so the less often you can do the better,</strong>” Efstratiou says.</p><p>Better yet, stylists also recommend using hair styling products infused with keratin (so basically all of the above) to keep your treatment looking fresh. “I like to recommend using keratin-infused products on days you do wash and style your hair,” says Shalom. “<strong>Extra doses of keratin help to refresh the treatment results</strong>.”</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-how-often-can-i-do-an-at-home-keratin-treatment><span>How Often Can I Do an At-Home Keratin Treatment?</span></h2><p>If you're using keratin-infused styling products that don't require heat activation, you're free to use your product of choice every single wash or at least once per week. That said, more intense treatments requiring heat activation should be applied sparingly. They're designed to last at least a couple of months, but the exact duration will vary from treatment to treatment. Make sure to double check the instructions on your bottle.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-are-at-home-keratin-treatments-safe><span>Are At-Home Keratin Treatments Safe?</span></h2><p>If you're using a keratin-infused product, you're good to go. If you're using a true at-home keratin system, it's worthwhile to exercise a little extra caution.
