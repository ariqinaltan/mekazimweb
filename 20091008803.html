Nights were spent playing in local jazz clubs, where the striped 'bee-like' jerseys he wore earned him his long-standing moniker from fellow musicians.&nbsp;</p><p id=e24ju9kLuc data-wc=21>Once qualified, the teacher-turned-musician taught English by day and gigged the city's punk clubs by night with his band Last Exit.</p><p id=eLgO2mNZc0 data-wc=9><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong> <a class=hm-link href=#>Inside Sting and Trudie Styler's outrageous £7million estate</a>&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c4c7a4834944-6270-sting.jpg><h2>Sting's band The Police</h2><p id=e8l4VCGFTh data-wc=46>He was also becoming increasingly disenchanted with the conventional life, however he'd married Frances Tomelty in 1976 and upped sticks again, relocating to London where he met drummer Stuart Copeland and guitarist Andy Summers, the duo with whom he would form legendary rock trio The Police.&nbsp;</p><p id=ezsws3azcZ data-wc=49>After a successful tour of the States during which they played the odd set in front of single-figure audiences, the band was signed by A&M records. Their first single, Roxanne, was a big hit leading the record company to rush to release a first album, Outlandos d'Amour, in 1979.&nbsp;</p><p id=ehJ5-oxsuIB data-wc=26>Their sophisticated take on the new wave sound was a hit on both sides of the Atlantic, and by 1982 The Police were filling 70,000-capacity stadiums.&nbsp;</p><h2>Sting's split from first wife</h2><p id=eM3ps4jNem data-wc=44>But something had to give, and it was Sting's two marriages to Frances and to The Police that came unravelled. Two acrimonious splits ensued (although Frances, Sting and The Police have since made up), and the singer put his musical career temporarily on hold.</p><p id=ePCqujJV-1 data-wc=23>After briefly focusing on acting - he starred in the Dennis Potter-penned Brimstone And Treacle - Sting went back to his first love.</p><p id=e6s7PeOnc_a data-wc=43>His first album, 1985\'s The Dream Of The Blue Turtles, was a successful mix of pop and jazz, and earned a Grammy nomination in the jazz category, which "horrified and dismayed" the musician, who saw himself as composing tunes for a mainstream audience.&nbsp;</p><p id=exGXB7uaxCn data-wc=10><strong>MORE: &nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Inside Sting and Trudie Styler's £40million New York penthouse</a>&nbsp;</p><h2>Losing his parents</h2><p id=eq0gFGSRxS5 data-wc=43>Then, in 1987, just six months after his mother, Sting's father Ernest died. The musician carried on as usual but his determination came at a price. He suffered three years of writer's block before realising he needed to write a record "about death".&nbsp;</p><p id=eMlhl119C8 data-wc=28>The Soul Cages was churned out in three weeks and was just what he needed, reconciling him to the family and background he had once rejected so vehemently.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a94c1c6a208a-sting-trudie-styler-announcement-d.jpg><h2>Sting's life now</h2><p id=e-6Sq4c-XW data-wc=15>These days Sting is as grounded a pop star as you are likely to find.&nbsp;</p><p id=eCF50PTsIK data-wc=54>He is still a prolific musician, having released several albums with a wide range of international singers, and occasionally returns to the big screen. He is famous for his stance on ecological issues as well as human rights, and was honoured by Chile at the beginning of 2001 for his contribution to the latter.&nbsp;</p><p id=eaVi61Cifj data-wc=33>Sting has continued with his successful solo career, with an eclectic mix of collaborators including sitar player Anoushka Shankar, Cuban legends Buena Vista Social Club, and a Grammy-winning song with Mary J Blige.&nbsp;</p><p id=eZ4ps5R_QJ data-wc=23>His most recent album, The Bridge, released in 2021, was his fifteenth studio album and first rock album since 2016's 57th & 9th.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfpb%2BwssilnKxnYmV9en2PaW9xaGNkwLW1zaBm</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f20091008803.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f20091008803.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f20091008803.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f20091008803.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f20091008803.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f20091008803.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./sylvester-stallone.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./sylvester-stallone.html>Sylvester Stallone: Latest News, Pictures &amp;amp; Videos</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./460521-sonya-miller-claims-master-p-kicked-her-out-of-the-house-p-responds-news.html>Sonya Miller Claims Master P Kicked Her Out Of The House, P Responds</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./460521-sonya-miller-claims-master-p-kicked-her-out-of-the-house-p-responds-news.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
