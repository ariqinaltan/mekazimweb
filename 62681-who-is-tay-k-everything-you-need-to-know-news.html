His presence has been growing heavily online for the past couple of weeks, thanks to his song “The Race” taking off on Soundcloud (currently #2 on Soundcloud’s top 50 chart, only under <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Cardi B</a>’s “Bodak Yellow”). He is getting equal exposure due to his involvement in a number of murders, amongst other crimes, including robbery.

As a collective, they would perform at various parties in order to build their presence within the local rap scene.</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>Lil Tay-K has been steadily putting up numbers on Soundcloud since 2015, from his earliest songs “<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Sly Cooper</a>” and “<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">BIFF XANNEN</a>,” to the most popular song on his page “Murder She Wrote”. While “The Race” is his biggest song to date, all of his songs have over 100,000 views on his Soundcloud.<br></span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>Origin Story</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>During an interview with Say Cheese TV, Tay-K stated that before moving to Texas, he lived with his parents in Long Beach, California. During that same interview he recalled being heavily influenced by his mother, a Baby Insane Crip, while stating that his relationship with his father, who is a Compton native, is not the best. He rated his overall relationship with his parents as a 6/10, and claimed that growing up, his parents did not give him much, leaving him to fend for himself.</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>Insofar as musical influence, Tay-K revealed that he got a lot of his flows from <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Chief Keef</a>, before calling <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Soulja Boy</a> his favorite rapper.<br></span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>Tay-K’s issues with the law began following a house robbery on July 26th ,2016, &nbsp;in Mansfield, Texas. This altercation, which ended with twenty-one year old, Ethan Walker being murdered, led to Tay-K being placed on house arrest. At 10:59, March 26th ,2017 Tay-K &nbsp;posted this tweet, after which he proceeded to cut off his ankle monitor.</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">This all culminated in him releasing “The Race” on Youtube, but was later arrested in New Jersey on Friday, June 30th, 2017, on the very same day. Following his most recent arrest, he had been identified as a suspect in a number of crimes, one of which occurred after his self-liberation from house arrest. These crimes were a robbery of a sixty-five year old man in Arlington Craven Park, which occurred on May 25th, 2017, and his involvement in another murder in San Antonio, TX following a performance with the Daytona Boyz, at a New Year’s Bash, on December 31st, 2015.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>Why did he go viral?</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>His notorious track “The Race,” which was released on the day of his arrest, has since become a viral hit. Within the song, he stated that if he killed someone and he got caught, he would run. The fact that Tay-K was involved in so many crimes helped propel a narrative that the internet simply couldn’t resist.</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>Since his rise to fame, he’s received a number of shoutouts from artists ranging from XXXtentacion, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Lil Bibby</a>, and Lil Yachty. Numerous artists have dropped their own versions of “The Race,” including Rico Recklezz, Trill Sammy, and Lil Yachty.</span></p><p>Who Is Tay-K?
