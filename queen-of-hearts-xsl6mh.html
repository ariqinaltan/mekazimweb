friend.</p><p>I wish I could have you all to myself.</p><p>I can't imagine what we'd get up to in my bedchamber.</p><p>[Marie Antoinette] Stop it.</p><p>Saint-Georges.</p><p>[giggles] Happy New Year.</p><p>[Saint-Georges] Happy New Year, darling.</p><p>[chuckles] Happy New Year, Majesty.</p><p>Shall we?</p><p>[giggles] Happy New Year.</p><p>Happy New Year, Princess.</p><p>Happy New Year.</p><p>Didn't we meet at a masked ball in Paris?</p><p>Count Axel von Fersen, Majesty.</p><p>Did we?</p><p>You followed me around the dance floor.</p><p>I seem to remember you followed me.</p><p>You asked me to dance.</p><p>I think you've got it the wrong way around.</p><p>Do I?</p><p>[chuckles] It was...</p><p>Magical.</p><p>[Stormont] Happy New Year, Monsieur.</p><p>And to you, Stormont.</p><p>Are you aware that American insurgents are using French weapons to mutilate and murder our soldiers?</p><p>Why should I care, Ambassador?</p><p>Well who do you think is supplying the arms and ammunition?</p><p>Are you absolutely certain?</p><p>You have your spies, we have ours.</p><p>I urge you to speak to your brother, Monsieur.</p><p>It cannot be in either of our interests to go to war, over a bunch of revolutionaries.</p><p>[Maurepas] Ugh.</p><p>When you declare your support for American independence, we must be prepared for England to declare war on us.</p><p>We will have 32 ships of the line, seven frigates, five corvettes and one lugger.</p><p>All ready for battle.</p><p>[Maurepas] Excellent.</p><p>Your Majesty.</p><p>[straining] We must have... naval superiority, in the English Channel.</p><p>[Louis-Auguste] We will.</p><p>[Maurepas] Then you will succeed where your grandfather failed, my boy.</p><p>[theme music playing] Why, why don't you take Madame Royale to the Petit Trianon when the war starts?</p><p>Shouldn't we stay here with you?</p><p>I'll, I'll visit you when, when I can.</p><p>I want you to be happy, Madam.</p><p>What about you?</p><p>I will be happy when we crush England.</p><p>They stole Canada and Louisiana from us.</p><p>And now we are going to take their American colonies away from them.</p><p>Tomorrow?</p><p>I can't wait.</p><p>[sighs] [Theresa] I fear I may not live to see the event that will seal our alliance.</p><p>Give me a break, Ma.</p><p>Can't you see we're trying?</p><p>[Theresa] Try harder.</p><p>[scoffs] And next time, pretend you are enjoying it!</p><p>[sighs] [Maurepas] Are all the ships ready to be launched?</p><p>[Louis-Auguste] I won't make my announcement until they are.</p><p>If we don't win in the Channel we can't send our troops to America.</p><p>We... we need the momentum of a victory to sail across the Atlantic.</p><p>[Maurepas] That's the way to do it.</p><p>You've got a good grasp of strategy, my boy.</p><p>We can discuss battle tactics when England takes the bait.</p><p>Which she will, the moment we publicly declare our support for her colonies.</p><p>He wants us to move to the Petit Trianon.</p><p>Would you like me to make the arrangements?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Only a Duchess is permitted to touch the Queen in public.</p><p>Have you met the Countess du Polignac?</p><p>Yolande to my friends.</p><p>Fersen to mine.</p><p>What brings you to Versailles?</p><p>I'm a soldier.</p><p>I hear that France may be preparing for a military engagement in America.</p><p>Where on earth did you hear that?</p><p>I've just arrived from England.</p><p>It's the topic of conversation at the court of St. James's.</p><p>I thought they only talked about me.</p><p>[Marie Antoinette and Yolande giggling] I can't believe he'd pick a fight with England.</p><p>[chuckles] Nobody takes on their navy and wins.</p><p>Rule Britannia.</p><p>-Britannia rule the waves.</p><p>-[Victoire and Adelaide laugh] This is no joke, Mesdames.</p><p>I'm deadly serious.</p><p>Why don't you speak to him, Provence?</p><p>Does he ever listen to me?</p><p>If he doesn't shout it from the roof tops.</p><p>You'll be seen as a safe pair of hands when it blows up in his face.</p><p>Josephine is right you know.</p><p>Say thank you.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>You're welcome darling.</p><p>Good afternoon.</p><p>Sire.</p><p>Good afternoon, Monsieur.</p><p>I have a simple question that requires a simple answer.</p><p>Why the hell are you preparing to go to war with England over her rebel colonies?</p><p>I am not.</p><p>Don't lie to me.</p><p>I know that ferret face too well.</p><p>Don't speak to me like that.</p><p>Do I need to remind you how fortunate you are to be here after your unforgiveable behaviour?</p><p>It had nothing to do with me.</p><p>She was responsible for the libelle.</p><p>And you were a co-conspirator.</p><p>I am still the heir to your throne.</p><p>Why shouldn't I speak out about matters that concern us as a family?</p><p>-If you slip up we will be... -I won't.</p><p>Why do you go out of your way to make me feel so powerless?</p><p>Because you are.</p><p>How could she come to France, Mercy?</p><p>Hasn't she heard the rumours about the war?</p><p>It's been ten years, Majesty, since you left Austria.</p><p>She would like to see you.</p><p>See me?</p><p>Or spy on me?</p><p>She hasn't stopped spying on me since the day I arrived.</p><p>Take your time, to reflect.</p><p>If she's missing me so much why don't you send her my portrait?</p><p>I am her mother.</p><p>Her sisters welcomed me with open arms.</p><p>She's only suggesting you go when she delivers the Dauphin.</p><p>When?</p><p>Don't you mean if?</p><p>That maybe why she's reluctant to have you, Ma.</p><p>She's terrified that she won't deliver.</p><p>I think we can all agree that she hasn't delivered.</p><p>Give her time.</p><p>She may have time, Joseph, I don't.</p><p>What is she wearing?</p><p>[imperceptible chatter] Mr Benjamin Franklin, the American Ambassador to France.</p><p>Welcome to Versailles, Mr Franklin.</p><p>Majesties.</p><p>I believe I have the honour to be the first Monarch to recognise the United Provinces of North America.</p><p>[applause] [Benjamin Franklin] Yes, indeed.</p><p>You have that honour, Sire.</p><p>And may I say, on behalf of Congress, -how very... -[Stormont] And may I say on behalf of England, there is no Congress!</p><p>There are no United Provinces.</p><p>America is a British colony subject to the rule of King George and to the parliament of Great Britain.</p><p>He is not an ambassador.</p><p>He's a renegade!</p><p>How long before England declares war on France?</p><p>As long as it takes Viscount Stormont to reach Windsor.</p><p>That long?</p><p>[Victoire] Say something.</p><p>My brother has no idea what he's getting us into.</p><p>Your Majesties, if I may?</p><p>If all monarchies were governed by the same principles which are in your hearts, there would be no need to form republics.</p><p>Thank you, Mr Franklin.</p><p>It is a pleasure to receive you.</p><p>[sighs] I understand we will be moving to the Petit Trianon shortly.</p><p>Should I start to prepare?</p><p>You don't need to lift a finger, Yolande is organising everything.</p><p>That's my job.</p><p>She's only trying to help you.</p><p>Is she?</p><p>[Marie Antoinette] Her chaps will be joining us there.</p><p>Where are they going to sleep?</p><p>In my bed.</p><p>In your bed?</p><p>[chuckles] Where are you going to sleep?</p><p>In the attic.</p><p>If that's the arrangement, I won't be coming.</p><p>Please don't be like that.</p><p>It's her or me.</p><p>You know, I need you both.</p><p>You are my rock.</p><p>She's my adventure.</p><p>She's thrown me out of your life, Toinette.</p><p>You are lost to me because of that woman.</p><p>Can't you make peace with her?</p><p>It would make our lives so much easier.</p><p>[child giggles] [imperceptible chatter] [Maurepas groans] Maurepas please, please, sit down.</p><p>Oh, don't fuss.</p><p>[chuckles] [groans] It's only, old age.</p><p>And, uh, you'll have to... Argh!</p><p>You'll have to endure it yourself one day.</p><p>[chuckles] A bucket of ice please.</p><p>While we have a moment, may I ask for your advice?</p><p>Oh isn't that what I'm here for, my boy?</p><p>My wife has requested 250,000 Livres, from the Privy Purse.</p><p>Has she?</p><p>Whatever for?</p><p>To cover the Polignac's debts.</p><p>My inclination is to refuse but...</p><p>I know that Count Jules is your cousin.</p><p>Oh, uh, naturally it's none of my business.</p><p>The Privy Purse, is yours to do whatever you like with.</p><p>But...</p><p>I think you should give the Queen a free rein in her household.</p><p>Uh, it will allow you, a free rein to rule France.</p><p>[knocking on door] Oh, Your Majesty.</p><p>Let me help you.</p><p>[flinches] [groans] [Louis-Auguste] Here.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>How in God's name, can we support a revolution?</p><p>What sort of an example is the King setting?</p><p>He is giving France the one thing we have been yearning for.</p><p>The chance to deprive our oldest enemy of the jewel in her crown.</p><p>[court] Hear, hear.</p><p>I am astonished you want to go to war with England, Chartres.</p><p>Isn't the Prince of Wales supposed to be your best friend?</p><p>When it comes to La Gloire, Monsieur, your best friend instantly becomes your worst enemy.</p><p>Excuse me gentlemen, duty calls.</p><p>Why only a Lieutenant Commander, cousin?</p><p>Surely you're capable of grappling a more senior position?</p><p>[Duc de Chartres] If it was up to me I'd be Grand Admiral of the fleet.</p><p>I am the most senior naval officer in this family.</p><p>So...</p><p>He refused to promote you?</p><p>I'm sure he had his reasons.</p><p>Perhaps he hasn't forgiven you for stealing his wife's affections?</p><p>Perhaps.</p><p>He's reduced me to a worthless appendage.</p><p>But... You do realise, if he screws up, we will be the first to benefit.</p><p>You have a point, cousin.</p><p>Are you leaving us, Princess?</p><p>I'm going to a spa, Mercy.</p><p>I need to rest.</p><p>My nerves can't take any more.</p><p>If circumstances change may I write to you?</p><p>I doubt they will.</p><p>Take care.</p><p>[man] Giddy up!</p><p>Come on.</p><p>[horse neighs] [knocking on door] Come in.</p><p>[door opens] Yolande.</p><p>[chuckles] What brings you to Paris?</p><p>You have an admirer, Fersen.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>Make the most of it.</p><p>We do.</p><p>[door closes] [Marie Antoinette] Can I tempt you to come to the Petit Trianon tomorrow night?</p><p>Dress warmly.</p><p>We love to party under the stars.</p><p>-[woman] Prost!</p><p>-[all] Prost!</p><p>[all cheering] -[man] Again, again!</p><p>-[all] Again.</p><p>One more... -Prost!</p><p>-[all] Prost!</p><p>Prost!</p><p>[glass clinks] [laughs] Are we expecting anyone else?</p><p>Do you think he'll turn up?</p><p>He can't turn down an invitation from the Queen.</p><p>[chuckles] I want him to come for me.</p><p>I tiptoed to come to Paris.</p><p>-[laughs] -Yeah.</p><p>[laughs] Majesty.</p><p>[chuckles] We don't call her that in private.</p><p>So what would you like me to call you?</p><p>Antoinette.</p><p>Welcome to our merry circle, Fersen.</p><p>Welcome.</p><p>[Yolande] Welcome, Fersen.</p><p>[chuckles] Come on let's play!</p><p>Run.</p><p>[all cheering and laughing] No.</p><p>No!</p><p>[squeals] [man laughing] -Ah!</p><p>-[woman chuckling] -[grunts] -[groans] -[woman screams] -Oh, my gosh!</p><p>You're a maniac.</p><p>Sorry.</p><p>[chuckles] [Marie Antoinette] Somebody take that away.</p><p>Are you alright?</p><p>I'm fine, thank you.</p><p>[grunts] Be careful.</p><p>Her husband doesn't like her cosying up to impossibly handsome men.</p><p>[Fersen coughs] I'm very sorry.</p><p>She's a tricky butterfly to catch.</p><p>You can't catch butterflies.</p><p>You can only trap them.</p><p>Hmm.</p><p>[thuds] The King.</p><p>[imperceptible chatter] [door closes] One month ago we recognised the United Provinces of America.</p><p>We expected England to retaliate.</p><p>And this morning, an English frigate fired on the Belle Poule.</p><p>[all gasp] I have therefore instructed Comte d'Orvilliers to launch our fleet.</p><p>Our Orleans cousin will command the third squadron.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, France and Great Britain are at war.</p><p>[applause] Am I still your favourite?</p><p>Who else could take your place?</p><p>Oh you know who.</p><p>Don't let him queer my pitch while I'm away.</p><p>Impossible.</p><p>It would take five Fersens to fill your boots.</p><p>Is that all?</p><p>I'm relying on you.</p><p>[Duc de Chartres] Mmm-hmm.</p><p>To deliver the naval victory we're all praying for.</p><p>I will press the petals of this rose between the leaves of my prayer book.</p><p>[chuckling] What prayer book?</p><p>A kiss for your departing warrior?</p><p>Come back to us safely.</p><p>Maurepas.</p><p>[imperceptible conversation] [Yolande] Count Mercy.</p><p>What a pleasant surprise.</p><p>Is that from the Empress?</p><p>May I speak to the Queen?</p><p>She's resting.</p><p>I'm sure she'll be delighted to talk to you when she resumes her official duties at the Chateau.</p><p>Shall I give it to her?</p><p>Please ask the Queen to send for me when she has read it.</p><p>Yes of course.</p><p>[Count Mercy] I have been unable to visit the Queen at the Petit Trianon, where she's keeping unsuitable company.</p><p>The Countess has assumed an iron grip over her.</p><p>The boy King, is making his bid to shine as brightly as the Sun King.</p><p>The war against England has electrified France.</p><p>But no one in diplomatic circles, expects him to succeed.</p><p>-[Marie Antoinette] Whoo!</p><p>-Hazard!</p><p>-That's a foul.</p><p>-That's a foul.</p><p>Don't be ridiculous.</p><p>-[Jules] It's a foul.</p><p>-No it's not a foul.</p><p>Antoinette.</p><p>Countess.</p><p>Gentlemen.</p><p>I, uh, wasn't expecting you.</p><p>Come with me.</p><p>Where are they heading off to I wonder?</p><p>Oh, the nearest bush -by the looks of things.</p><p>-[all chuckle] She doesn't have the balls.</p><p>Welcome to the Petit Trianon.</p><p>This looks like an English flower market.</p><p>Wait, are you a closet Anglophile?</p><p>Don't tell anyone.</p><p>So...

them both, happy?</p><p>[both chuckle] Well whatever they ask me to do I do.</p><p>Hmm.</p><p>For instance?</p><p>For instance.</p><p>They have set their hearts on the County of Bitche.</p><p>Now I know it's outrageously extravagant, but I said I'd mention it to you.</p><p>It is outrageous, you are right.</p><p>They should be satisfied with the gift they have just received from Louis.</p><p>[Vaudreuil] Who helped her to entertain the Swede behind everyone's back?</p><p>She owes us big time.</p><p>[Jules] She'll come around.</p><p>[Vaudreuil] Well, if she doesn't, we will

triumph in the English channel.</p><p>Has she replied to my letter?</p><p>Mercy says she will write to you, Ma.</p><p>She's punishing me.</p><p>I have been a bad mother.</p><p>You have been a great ruler, Ma.</p><p>Where is the King?</p><p>I need to speak to him now.</p><p>Are you sure about this?</p><p>Come and see for yourself.</p><p>[d'Orvilliers] The charges against you are egregious.</p><p>Failure to obey my order to engage the enemy.</p><p>I misread your signal.</p><p>Fleeing the Saint Esprit mid-battle.</p><p>We had already won.</p><p>The King appointed you to command the last squadron.</p><p>Not to quit your post and run off to Versailles.</p><p>I didn't quit.</p><p>The battle was over.</p><p>I came back to announce the victory to the only person who mattered.</p><p>If you had stayed, you could have knocked out their ships at the rear.</p><p>And our victory would not just have been a triumph, it would have been crowned in glory.</p><p>I can only conclude, it was a deliberate ploy on your part.</p><p>What do you mean by that?</p><p>Comte d'Orvilliers has reached the conclusion that you are a traitor, Monseigneur.</p><p>[d'Orvilliers] Did your friendship to England outweigh your loyalty to France?</p><p>Is this about us?</p><p>It's got nothing to do with me.</p><p>[Duc de Chartres] Then why are you here?</p><p>I wanted to see your face, when you were accused of betraying your country.</p><p>I'm not the traitor.</p><p>I have no choice but to dismiss you from the Navy and order you to leave Versailles.</p><p>[Duc de Chartres] You will both regret this.</p><p>[Provence] Will you go to Paris?</p><p>[Duc de Chartres] I can't.</p><p>He has banned me from coming within 50 miles of the Chateau.</p><p>[Provence] His luck can't last.</p><p>[Duc de Chartres] Neither can hers.</p><p>I'm glad you've finally seen the light, cousin.</p><p>Keep in touch.</p><p>[Duc de Chartres] You too.</p><p>[Provence] Oh, I will.</p><p>[Louis-Auguste] I have banished Chartres from Versailles.</p><p>I will dispatch Fersen to America.</p><p>Then, she will come back to me.</p><p>Majesties.</p><p>I have brought Mr Franklin to inspect the troops before you leave for America.</p><p>General Rochambeau.</p><p>[Rochambeau] Mr Franklin.</p><p>It's an honour to be fighting for the United States.</p><p>This is Count Fersen, my aide-de-camp, thanks to you, Sire.</p><p>Thank you, Sire.</p><p>Majesty.</p><p>I'm sorry to see you go, Count Fersen.</p><p>[Marie Antoinette] Mama.</p><p>[crying] [Marie Antoinette crying]
