The balance sheet provided is a complicated one, owing to a “change in fair value of derivative liabilities” unrelated to the day-to-day expenses of the company.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">When putting aside the value of the derivative liability, the company has lost $60.5 million since it launched, including operating losses and interest payments. If you include the value of the derivative liability, you would get a loss of $31.5 million.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The financial situation of TMTG is such that “TMTG’s independent registered public accounting firm has indicated that TMTG’s financial condition raises substantial doubt as to its ability to continue as a going concern,” according to the filing.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In a frank assessment of its business, the filing says that “as of June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, management has substantial doubt that TMTG will have sufficient funds to meet its liabilities as they fall due, including liabilities related to promissory notes previously issued by TMTG,” and that “TMTG believes that it may be difficult to raise additional funds through traditional financing sources in the absence of material progress toward completing its merger with Digital World.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The filing indicates that, if TMTG is unable to complete the merger with DWAC and receive the pot of money on the line, it may not survive.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">While TMTG was valued at $875 million when the merger with DWAC was first announced, Trump <a href=#>revealed</a> in his latest financial disclosure form that his controlling stake is valued at between $5 million and $25 million.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The amended S-4 filing also broke out a number of updates and risk factors related to the company, including the fact that the long-planned streaming video service appears to be off the table for now. The filing makes no mention of the service (which <a href=#>was teased</a> with conservative comedy specials and “Trump-specific programming”) except in relation to layoffs.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“On March&nbsp;1, 2023, TMTG eliminated several positions,” the filing said. “This action followed a review of all departments, most significantly impacted TMTG’s streaming video on demand (SVOD) and infrastructure teams.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Trump <a href=#>announced</a> his tech and media company in late 2021, framing it as a competitor to big tech platforms like Facebook and Twitter.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In May 2022, Trump <a href=#>agreed to make</a> Truth Social his primary social platform, agreeing not to post on other platforms until six hours after he sends a “Truth.” However, since initially signing the deal with TMTG, Elon Musk acquired Twitter and <a href=#>reinstated</a> Trump’s account (he also rebranded it as “X.”)</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">According to Monday’s filing, Trump on Oct. 30 “verbally affirmed” that he will continue to honor that agreement at least until the merger is complete.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The filing details a number of risks related to TMTG’s business and operations … but also has an entire section titled “Risks Related to our Chairman President Donald J. Trump,” citing his ongoing legal challenges, the companies he owned that have filed for bankruptcy (like his Atlantic City casino) and the companies that licensed his name (like Trump Vodka and Trump Shuttle), which subsequently went out of business.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“There can be no assurances that TMTG will not also fail,” the company warns.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>Correction: </strong>This story has been updated to more accurately reflect TMTG’s net losses as disclosed on its balance sheet. An initial read of the Nov. 13 securities filing, since updated on Nov. 14, reported that Truth Social posted a $50 million loss in 2022, when in fact that figure was listed as a profit.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8GuqqKmlajAcLDIoKCtmZxkwbPBzKlkraqlqbVuv86coJqkXaG8tL%2FErGSrnaaau7axjKucr52RobKlecWipZqmk5rAbrDArZhmaWJogneAlHFocWc%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftrump-truth-social-losses-revenue-revealed-finances-data-1235645818.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftrump-truth-social-losses-revenue-revealed-finances-data-1235645818.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftrump-truth-social-losses-revenue-revealed-finances-data-1235645818.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftrump-truth-social-losses-revenue-revealed-finances-data-1235645818.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftrump-truth-social-losses-revenue-revealed-finances-data-1235645818.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftrump-truth-social-losses-revenue-revealed-finances-data-1235645818.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./tyrus-age-birthday-wife-kids-real-name.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./tyrus-age-birthday-wife-kids-real-name.html>Tyrus Biography, Age, Birthday, Wife, Kids, Real Name, Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./troy-massey-net-worth-2024.html>Troy Massey Net Worth 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./troy-massey-net-worth-2024.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
