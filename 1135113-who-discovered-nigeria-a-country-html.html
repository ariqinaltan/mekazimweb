About four centuries later, British journalist Flora Shaw allegedly formulated the name "Nigeria" for the Niger River and its environs. Nonetheless, some historic publications debunk this story.

She is said to have coined the name for the River Niger and its surroundings, ' River Niger Area' — a term the British colonialists used to refer to the region. So, <i>The Times</i> journalist combined "Niger" and "Area" to create" Nigeria.</p><p class=align-left>In the 1897 article, Flora Shaw wrote:</p>The name Nigeria applying to no other part of Africa may without offence to any neighbors be accepted as coextensive with the territories over which the Royal Niger Company has extended British influence, and may serve to differentiate them equally from the colonies of Lagos and the Niger Protectorate on the coast and from the French territories of the Upper Niger.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/c155cf973bb46156.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>“Niger can thwart ECOWAS sanctions": Military-appointed PM sends strong words to West African leaders</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Scholars invested in knowing who truly named Nigeria claim a book published in 1862, <i>Life in the Niger</i> by William Cole, mentioned ‘Nigerians’ in two places.
