Little information is available about her early childhood and educational background.&nbsp;However, Scorsese is known to have graduated from high school.&nbsp;Nicolette Scorsese fell in love with acting and modeling when she was a child.&nbsp;She aspired to a career in Hollywood and began modeling.&nbsp;Her acting dream came true much later, when she was in her early 30s.&nbsp;She made her television debut in 1985 in the award-winning television series The A-Team.&nbsp;The action series followed four Vietnam vets who are facing charges for a crime they didn’t commit.&nbsp;They run for their lives while saving innocent people.&nbsp;Scorsese had a minor role as Cindy on the series.</span></p><p><span>Nicolette Scorsese’s next role came in the 1988 film,&nbsp;</span><span>Perfect Victims;&nbsp;</span><span>a horror/thriller about a psycho who blames women for the fact that he contracted AIDS.&nbsp;So he begins to stalk and kill beautiful women as a form of revenge.&nbsp;Scorsese played the role of one of those beautiful women named Melissa Cody.&nbsp;The starlet got her reputed big break in the 1989 film,&nbsp;</span><span>The National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation</span><span>.&nbsp;The film follows the antics of the Griswold family as they plan the perfect vacation.&nbsp;However, their perfect plans are ruined when a cousin moves his RV into their property.&nbsp;They also have to deal with their employer’s refusal to pay an agreed-upon Christmas bonus.&nbsp;In the film, Scorsese plays the role of a sexy department store clerk and the protagonist (Clark Griswold) fantasizes about her.</span></p><p><span>After the Christmas break from The National Lampoon, Nicolette Scorsese garnered minor roles in such films as&nbsp;</span><span>Aspen Extreme</span><span>&nbsp;(1993),&nbsp;</span><span>Fun in Girls Shorts</span><span>&nbsp;(2004),&nbsp;</span><span>I’ll Do Anything</span><span>&nbsp;(1994),&nbsp;</span><span>Girls in Prison</span><span>&nbsp;(1994), and&nbsp;</span><span>Boxing Helena</span><span>&nbsp;(1993).&nbsp;Nicolette Scorsese also acted in TV series like&nbsp;</span><span>NYPD Blues, ER, Charles in Charge, LA Law.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Family Facts</span></strong></h2><p><span>There are no details on Scorsese’s parents or siblings.&nbsp;Some people mistakenly assume that she is related to Martin Scorsese, a highly acclaimed film director.&nbsp;He is one of the most accomplished filmmakers in Hollywood and has done such blockbuster films as&nbsp;</span><span>Crime Organizations of New York</span><span>&nbsp;,&nbsp;</span><span>The Wolf of Wall Street</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>The Dead</span><span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;The deceased got him an Oscar for best director.&nbsp;Despite the similarity in names, there is no relationship between Nicolette Scorsese and Martin Scorsese.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Man</span></strong></h2><p><span>Nicolette Scorsese has never been married.&nbsp;However, she has been romantically involved with a few people, including Antonio Sabato Jr. He is an Italian-American model, actor, and politician who she reportedly worked with early in her modeling career.&nbsp;Scorsese is also said to have dated Jelly Bean Benitez and Billy Duffy.&nbsp;Benitez is a Puerto Rican-born American DJ and music producer.&nbsp;He has produced songs for legends such as Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson and Madonna.&nbsp;Duffy, on the other hand, is a British rock musician.&nbsp;The exact timeline of these relationships is unknown, meaning it could just be a rumor.&nbsp;If there’s one confirmed relationship Scorsese has been in, it’s her relationship with Sean Penn, an Oscar-winning filmmaker.</span></p><p><span>At the moment it’s not sure who her love interest is, if she is single or just keeping details of her love life away from public scrutiny.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Height</span></strong></h2><p><span>Nicolette Scorsese is 5 feet 10 inches tall (1.78m).&nbsp;Her weight is given as 60 kg.&nbsp;Other additional measurements are chest – 35 inches, waist – 26 inches and hips – 35 inches.&nbsp;Her hair color is brown while her eye color is blue.&nbsp;During her heyday, Scorsese was a stunning beauty.&nbsp;One can only hope that time and age have been kind to her.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p class=postsid
