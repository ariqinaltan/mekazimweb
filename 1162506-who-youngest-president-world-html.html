But the post of the president of the country is more often a burden, a responsibility, and hard work. It’s not a privilege, at least for a person who cares about their country. No wonder that such power is associated with a venerable age. After all, an effective manager must be experienced in order to fulfill his/her duties successfully. That is why in most countries, the age limit is set for candidates willing to compete for the main chair of the state. To take part in the election fever, the participants must be in their 30s. But the electorate gives preference to the experience. That’s how it was until recently until a generation of millennials entered the game. Today, politics is getting younger. So who is the youngest president in the world?</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e05fa10b8f46b556.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nigeria progressing to anachy: Olu Falae makes terrible statement about 2023 general elections</span></p></a><h2>Top of the youngest presidents in the world</h2><p class=align-left>Before we’ll find out who the youngest president in the whole world is, let’s see, which countries are run currently or were run by young politicians in the past?</p><h3>Joseph Kabila</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e05fa10b8f46b556.jpg><p class=align-left>Joseph Kabila, the fourth president of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, opens our list.

In 2005, after the death of his father, the previous ruler of Togo, he swore an oath, as a caretaker, in the name of stability in the country. Although under the country laws, these powers did not belong to him, but to the National Assembly President Fambaré Ouattara. That is why, after Faure had claimed himself acting president, the society, and the neighboring states called his actions illegitimate. Gnassingbé gave up the post to Ouattara, and he appointed the date of the elections, in which Gnassingbe won supported by the armed forces.
